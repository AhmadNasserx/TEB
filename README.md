# TEB
TEB, players take on the role of Laura, a young woman unraveling the emotional entanglements of her family’s past. With the ability to shift between two distinct worlds—a cozy, top-down pixel-art present in Laura’s home, and a hauntingly beautiful, first-person voxel past in the Time Encapsulation Bureau—you must solve intricate puzzles that span time and space.

The goal? To leave a heartfelt message for Laura’s father, freeing him from the "bubble" of memories that has trapped him in a cycle of regret. Manipulate objects, alter timelines, and discover hidden truths by seamlessly transitioning between these worlds, where every choice echoes through time.

Will you uncover the key to setting Laura’s father free? Or will the past remain an unbroken loop? Bubbles of Time is a poignant and cerebral adventure where your actions shape the story and time itself bends to your will.
